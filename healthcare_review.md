# Literature Review - Healthcare 

## NHS Capacity Shortages

Seasonal fluctuation in healthcare demand is a known phenomenon. The winter season sees increased numbers of unwell patients requiring admission due to infectious illnesses as well as due to prior conditions that are exacerbated in winter [AMS20, pp.9, AMS21, pp.63]. 

The NHS has fewer beds than comparable major European countries [NHS19, pp.18] Further, the NHS has been operating at critically high occupancy since before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018/19 bed occupancy averaged 90.2% and exceeded 95% in the winter season [AMS21, pp.62]. Since the start of the pandemic, this problem was exacerbated by the reduced availability in general and acute beds due to IPC measures [AMS21, pp.50, 62].

Past research on safe and efficient levels of hospital occupancy has had mixed results: 

 - Some studies have found discharge a greater proportion of long-stay patients when the hospital is experiencing high demand [Harrison13].
 - Others have found insufficient evidence overall, but a more pronounced relationship when dealing with older or sicker patients, indicating possible links like in short-fallings in the discharge process [Friebel19, pp.7]. 
 - In the intensive care setting, evidence exists that increased ICU occupancy is associated with an increased risk of early death, and that overloading the capacity of an ICU may affect physician decision-making, resulting in premature discharge out of the ICU [Chursch09].

## Rapid Discharge from Care

During the initial COVID outbreak, government guidance directed rapid discharge of every patient that was clinically ready. It required transfer off wards within one hour of a discharge decision to a designated discharge area, and then discharge from hospital as soon as possible, normally within two hours [SCIE22, pp.1].

Rapid hospital discharge and avoidance, especially in the early months of the pandemic, resulted in deaths, trauma, limits to people’s freedom and choices, and many people not getting support that is right for them [SCIE22, pp.1].

The 2016 report by the Health Service Ombudsman on unsafe discharge from hospital publicised 9 unresolved complaints to the NHS indicative of systematic faults that existed prior to the pandemic [PSHO16]. They identified four main causes of unsafe discharge events. Relevant to us are:
 - Patients discharged before they are clinically ready
 - Patients not being assessed or consulted properly before discharge (not ready to cope at home)

The House of Commons' followup to this report acknowledged the shortages of hospital beds as an impetus for staff to hurry patients through the discharge process [Commons16, pp.12]
 - They noted occurrences of "discharge teams" responsible for identifying patients who may be discharged immediately, to reduce resource strain. This practice was condemned by Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association representatives [Commons16, pp.12].
 - They noted that "Clinically fit for discharge" has come to mean "medically stable" enough to no longer require the services of an acute hospital, and does not imply recovery [Commons16, pp.8].
 - Finally, they stated the need for improved data on discharge, with an emphasis on emergency readmission statistics [Commons16, pp.8]

Internationally, a qualitative case study in the Norwegian hospital system acknowledges that full hospital wards induce a pressure to discharge patients and free up beds. While some physicians asserted that medical justifiability of discharge decisions was not compromised, others felt the pressure forced them to adjust the threshold for when they percieved discharging a patient to be reasonable [Glette19, pp.7]. 


## Mitigation Strategies

A central aim of the NHS' pre-mandemic (2019) long-term plan was to reduce pressure on emergency hospital services [NHS19]. This was to be achieved by streamlining A&E and UTC care, providing alternatives such as enhanced 111 phone service, and the Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) program to avoid overnight admission

The post-pandemic SAM followup report found 45% of built SDEC units were used as overflow beds, and overall the service had been displaced [Thorlby21]

 	[NHS19, pp.21] demonstrates the increase in zero-day admissions, while the latest data in [Thorlby21, pp. 19] mentions levels are now in line with the long-term plan's ambition of ~1/3 of total non-elective stays. SAM is not clear on whether SDEC benefitted this.

Among the immediate issues to be addressed, the SCIE has identified [SCIE22, pp.3-4]:
 - Using evidence about risks to understand local impacts and avoid repetition of what did not go well
 - Understanding the impacts felt across different communities
 	
An important risk mitigation strategy is to minimise latent errors in the process, i.e. unsafe processes that enable or exacerbate the potential for human error or patient harm [Waring14, pp.10]. *Standardised discharge criteria*, if designed well, would lead to a reduced length of stay in hospital. However, if the criteria were poorly developed or applied this might result in poorer postdischarge outcomes including hospital readmission, mortality and adverse events [NICE18, pp.10]. Currently, their use is neither routine nor uniform across the NHS, and it is unlikely that a single standardised set of criteria could be used across all conditions and patient groups NICE18, pp.11]. 

Nevertheless, studies have been put forward to explore the use of objective data to assist in discriminating which patients should not be discharged without risk of bad outcome and/or should undergo special surveillance [Ouanes12]. Knowledge of the risk factors for readmission may help identify high-risk patients before determining whether discharge is appropriate

The problem of accommodating patients with acute medical needs under heavy capacity constraints has been studied as a worst-case scenario in an ICU setting as "The ritual of the last bed" [Teres93]. Work has been published that models demand-driven discharge under different aggressive and cautious policies based on objective data, mortality risk, readmission risk, and expected length of stay [Azcarate20]. Influential work on the ethics of the topic has asserted that "the basis for regulating admission, discharge, or triage from the special care unit should be medical suitability (from a utilitarian or egalitarian point of view)" [Teres93].
