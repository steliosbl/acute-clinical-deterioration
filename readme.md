## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the linked paper, including all data pre-processing, model training and tuning, systematic comparisons of model variations, and evaluation. The Jupyter notebooks at the root directory document the experiments we ran to demonstrate the models' performance and accuracy on the proprietary dataset.

We apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to predict patient deterioration early, based on their first recorded vital signs, observations, laboratory results, and other predictors documented in Electronic Patient Records. We build on prior work by incorporating interpretable machine learning and fairness-aware modelling, and achieve improved classification performance over the current standard, the National Early Warning Score 2 [1], measured by average precision and daily alert rate. 

We use a cross-sectional Electronic Patient Record dataset comprising 121,058 unplanned admissions at Salford Royal Hospital, UK, to systematically compare model variations for predicting mortality and critical care utilisation within 24 hours of admission. We use Shapely Additive exPlanations [2] to justify the models' outputs, verify that the captured data associations align with domain knowledge, and pair predictions with the causal context of each patientâ€™s most influential characteristics.
